Welcome to the Online Drum Kit repository! In this project, I have created a virtual drum kit using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The online drum kit allows users to play different drum sounds by clicking on the corresponding drum pads or using keyboard keys. By following the steps outlined in this README, you will understand how to use and customize the Online Drum Kit for your own music-related projects.

## Features

- **Interactive Drum Pads**: The online drum kit consists of various drum pads, each representing a different drum sound. Users can click on the drum pads to trigger the corresponding drum sound.

- **Keyboard Support**: Users can also play the drum sounds by pressing the associated keyboard keys. Each drum pad is mapped to a specific key on the keyboard, providing a seamless and interactive drumming experience.

- **Responsive Design**: The drum kit is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring optimal user experience across platforms.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Online Drum Kit, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/UB30-4/drumkit`
2. Open the project files in your preferred code editor.
3. Customize the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files to modify the drum kit layout, design, or sounds, if desired.
4. Start a local development server or open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.
5. Interact with the drum pads by clicking on them or using the associated keyboard keys to play the drum sounds.
